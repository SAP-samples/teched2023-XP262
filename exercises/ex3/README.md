In this screen you can select your device type (iOS or Android) and switch between the two QR Codes via the toggle button:
- Install: This QR-Code can be used to install the SAP Mobile Start app on your device. It’s a direct link to the Apple app store page.
- Register: This QR-Code is used later within the SAP Mobile Start app to register it to your site.

> [!NOTE]
> For the deployment to end-users it’s possible to make use of Mobile Device Management (MDM). Administrators can deploy a managed app configuration via the MDM that contains site information. With that end-users can onboard without the need to scan a QR code. See the documentation for further information.
